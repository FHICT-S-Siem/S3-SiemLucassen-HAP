# Cultural diffrences
Can I work with people from other cultures? 

## What is culture? 
According to (CARLA, 2019) 
> “For the purposes of the Intercultural Studies Project, culture is defined as the shared patterns of behaviors and interactions, cognitive constructs, and affective understanding that are learned through a process of socialization. <br> 
These shared patterns identify the members of a culture group while also distinguishing those of another group.“ 

For me culture is defined by your knowledge of people, what behaviors they have and their habits, cuisine, music etc. <br>
I've been surrounded with a lot of cultures in my life, therefore I am aware when there are cultural differences and I can act upon those.

## Which cultural aspects would you keep in mind when facing cultural differences? 
As stated by (The Culture Map, E. Meyer).
> "By analyzing the positioning of one culture relative to another, the dimensions enable you to decode how culture influences your own international collaboration." <br>

Be open minded and aware of their cultural diffrences awareness. You would have to find out a bit about how the other person communicate in their part of the world. <br>
For instance, (Natasha Lane, n.d.). 
> “I’ll finish this soon” can mean a lot of things in different countries, and if you don’t seem to understand each other when it comes to certain phrases or ideas, don’t automatically blame it on the person’s laziness or irresponsibility. <br>


## How can cultures be clustured? 
As stated by (The Culture Map, E. Meyer, 2014, p. 204, 205 & 208).
> To understand how cultural patterns can interact with one another, it's necessary to map the Disagreeing scale against a second scale that measures how emotionally expressive a culture is. <br>

To summarize these quadrants I made a short list of the diffrences:
 - In quadrant A, emotions pour out-and this includes the emotions associated with disagreement, which can be expressed with little likelihood of relationships being harmed. Most European cultures fall into this quadrant <br>
 - In quadrant B, which houses some countries like Germany and the Netherlands, includes cultures that are generally not emotionally expressive, yet see debate and and disagreement the way the French do- as a critical step on the path to truth.
 - In quadrant C, emotional expression is common but open disagreements are dangerous. In many Arabic cultures, people make extreme efforts not to offend others by expressing direct disagreement, as the ramifications for the long-term relationship could be serious. <br>
 - In quadrant D, emotions are expressed more subtly and disagreements are expressed more softly. Most Asians cultures fall into this quadrant.

## Can you give examples for things going not as expected when interacting with people from other cultures? What and why went differently? 

**Wearing shoes in the house** <br>
According to (Beth, 2011):
> Germans, along with other countries such as Japan, Russia, Korea, Turkey, Thailand, India, and other Eastern countries have the custom of removing shoes in homes. The no shoe policy also carries over to Scandinavian countries, most European countries, some African countries, and a majority of the Middle East. <br>
> For the health of your children and family, especially babies or toddlers; <br>

> **why you shouldn’t wear shoes in the house** 
1 Shoes pick up and carry into your home toxins and chemicals such as pesticides, fertilizers, traces of petrol fumes, industrial pollution, human and animal waste. <br>
2 Bacteria brought in from shoes can cause stomach and lung infections <br>
3 EPA conducted a “door mat study” showing that 60% less lead dust and other chemicals were brought into the home by removing shoes and using a front door mat. <br> There was also a reduction in allergens and bacteria tracked into the home. <br>

When I get home myself, I would still wear my shoes after driving back home from college until I feel like taking them off. <br>
The thought behind that is more so the smell of the feet after the ride back. <br>


## What is your culture? 
My culture being dutch, is eating typical dutch food on a planned time with my family. I eat bread with add-ons such as chocolate sprinkles troughout the whole day and mostly meat-potato dishes at dinner. <br>
The typical dutch person would attend to dutch holidays such as sinterklaas, carnaval, kerstmis(christmas) and nieuw jaarsavond(new years eve). <br>
To my understanding dutch people are quite upfront and honest which sometimes leads to having cultural diffrences. <br> 
Sometimes dutch people think they are just being honest but they come across as if they're being bold. <br>
Most dutch people love sports such as voetball(soccer) and love to ride their bike to their office or college.

## How would you  act in the future when you know that you need to communicate or collaborate with a person from another culture?
When I meet new people I would slowly work my way into their background and be interested but not too exaggerated and ask questions general questions, so we could get comfortable to work/talk with eachother. <br>
I will often ask these general questions whilst on a school-break, sometimes we can relate to one other and that makes the process of adapting to their culture much easier.


## What did I do to improve the group communications with respect to cultural differences? 
In this semester, my Dutch group-members and me had the opportunity to work with a person who comes from Indonesia. The first lunch-break, we showed him around our local shops and talked about his culture to get introduced. <br>
I noticed he was well spoken in the English language and told him so. We as a group tried our hardest to always speak English if he was present either in real-life or online.
