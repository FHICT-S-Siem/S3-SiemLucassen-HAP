# S3-SiemLucassen-HAP
Home assistant platform in React, Java Spring with microservice architecture and Python for the Jetson Nano scripts.

## Motivation

The goal of this project is to have a wall mounted tablet running a dashboard to control for my room.

The goal is really to have one screen without any menu so I can have a global view of the more important thing in the home: temperature, lights, camera.
