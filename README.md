# S3-SiemLucassen-HAP
Home assistant platform is made with React, Java Spring with microservice architecture and Python (with RabbitMQ communication) for the Jetson Nano scripts.

The reason for working a mono repository is stated in my portfolio after doing research with a fellow classmate.

## Motivation

The goal of this project is to have a wall mounted tablet running a dashboard to control for my home.

The goal is to have one screen with a small menu for rooms so I can have a global view of the measurements of my Jetson Nano's in my home.
