# UX Research

For my individual project I made a quick design in Figma (shown below) <br>

However, I also contributed to the [group-project](https://github.com/FHICT-S-Owen/RestaurantSPA) where I made a usability test of a design I made.

## Usability Testing
The application is for automating a process of taking orders in a restaurant. Customers can order food on a menu page which I designed along with [Daniel](https://github.com/danielvaswani) in Figma too. <br>

We discussed with the teacher to each test different usability testing methods, so we can diversify our scope and see for ourselves what the most approachable method is when it comes to usability testing. <br> <br>
I made a usability test with the method called [First Click](https://www.hotjar.com/usability-testing/methods/). The issue is labeled with 'good first issue', so it's easily discoverable on the Github-marketplace. <br>
[Dirk](https://github.com/DirkLemmen/) opened up a couple issues for me and my team-members to contribute our [usability tests](https://github.com/DirkLemmen/Researches/issues/10). <br>

I asked Rik Leemans a team member of mine from the previous semester, if he would like to test my design and executed it as follows:

I asked the participant to order a product and state how long their process took in seconds and where they would click to order the product. I Also provided some information regarding how to upload their video.


<br> 
He showed where he would click via the video and stated how much time the took to order the product: 4.5s.
