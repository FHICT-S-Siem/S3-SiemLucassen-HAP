# Cultural differences
Can I work with people from other cultures? 

## What is culture? 
According to (CARLA, 2019) 
> “For the purposes of the Intercultural Studies Project, culture is defined as the shared patterns of behaviors and interactions, cognitive constructs, and affective understanding that are learned through a process of socialization. <br> 
These shared patterns identify the members of a culture group while also distinguishing those of another group.“ 

For me culture is defined by your knowledge of people, what behaviors they have and their habits, cuisine, music etc. <br>
I've been surrounded with a lot of cultures in my life, therefore I am aware when there are cultural differences and I can act upon those.

## Which cultural aspects would you keep in mind when facing cultural differences? 
As stated by (The Culture Map, E. Meyer).
> "By analyzing the positioning of one culture relative to another, the dimensions enable you to decode how culture influences your own international collaboration." <br>

Be open minded and aware of their cultural diffrences awareness. You would have to find out a bit about how the other person communicate in their part of the world. <br>
For instance, (Natasha Lane, n.d.). 
> “I’ll finish this soon” can mean a lot of things in different countries, and if you don’t seem to understand each other when it comes to certain phrases or ideas, don’t automatically blame it on the person’s laziness or irresponsibility. <br>


## How can cultures be clustured? 
As stated by (The Culture Map, E. Meyer, 2014, p. 204, 205 & 208).
> To understand how cultural patterns can interact with one another, it's necessary to map the Disagreeing scale against a second scale that measures how emotionally expressive a culture is. <br>

To summarize these quadrants I made a short list of the diffrences:
 - In quadrant A, emotions pour out-and this includes the emotions associated with disagreement, which can be expressed with little likelihood of relationships being harmed. Most European cultures fall into this quadrant <br>
 - In quadrant B, which houses some countries like Germany and the Netherlands, includes cultures that are generally not emotionally expressive, yet see debate and and disagreement the way the French do- as a critical step on the path to truth.
 - In quadrant C, emotional expression is common but open disagreements are dangerous. In many Arabic cultures, people make extreme efforts not to offend others by expressing direct disagreement, as the ramifications for the long-term relationship could be serious. <br>
 - In quadrant D, emotions are expressed more subtly and disagreements are expressed more softly. Most Asians cultures fall into this quadrant.

## Can you give examples for things going not as expected when interacting with people from other cultures? What and why went differently? 

**Wearing shoes in the house** <br>
According to (Beth, 2011):
> Germans, along with other countries such as Japan, Russia, Korea, Turkey, Thailand, India, and other Eastern countries have the custom of removing shoes in homes. The no shoe policy also carries over to Scandinavian countries, most European countries, some African countries, and a majority of the Middle East. <br>
> For the health of your children and family, especially babies or toddlers; <br>

> **why you shouldn’t wear shoes in the house** 
1 Shoes pick up and carry into your home toxins and chemicals such as pesticides, fertilizers, traces of petrol fumes, industrial pollution, human and animal waste. <br>
2 Bacteria brought in from shoes can cause stomach and lung infections <br>
3 EPA conducted a “door mat study” showing that 60% less lead dust and other chemicals were brought into the home by removing shoes and using a front door mat. <br> There was also a reduction in allergens and bacteria tracked into the home. <br>

When I get home myself, I would still wear my shoes after driving back home from college until I feel like taking them off. <br>
The thought behind that is more so the smell of the feet after the ride back. <br>


## What is your culture? 
My culture being dutch, is eating typical dutch food on a planned time with my family. I eat bread with add-ons such as chocolate sprinkles troughout the whole day and mostly meat-potato dishes at dinner. <br>
The typical dutch person would attend to dutch holidays such as sinterklaas, carnaval, kerstmis(christmas) and nieuw jaarsavond(new years eve). <br>
To my understanding dutch people are quite upfront and honest which sometimes leads to having cultural diffrences. <br> 
Sometimes dutch people think they are just being honest but they come across as if they're being bold. <br>
Most dutch people love sports such as voetbal(soccer/football) and love to ride their bike to their office or college.

## How would you act in the future when you know that you need to communicate or collaborate with a person from another culture?
When I meet new people I would slowly work my way into their background and be interested but not too exaggerated and ask general questions, so we could get comfortable to work/talk with eachother. <br>
I will often ask these general questions whilst on a school-break, sometimes we can relate to one other and that makes the process of adapting to their culture much easier.

## What did I do to improve the group communications with respect to cultural differences? 
In this semester, my Dutch group-members and me had the opportunity to work with a person who comes from Indonesia. The first lunch-break, we showed him around our local shops and talked about his culture to get introduced. <br>
I noticed he was well spoken in the English language and told him so. We as a group tried our hardest to always speak English if he was present either in real-life or online. <br>

I could tell when he wouldn't understand things, and try to notify the group about it that this person is not on the same level. Sometimes body language is also an indication of whether he is following the conversation with the group. I noticed, when we were talking online he would often avoid confrontation, though he is quite emotionally expressive. To my understanding he would find jokes made up by the team funny and laugh expressively, but would rather not make one of his own to avoid confrontation. <br>


# Ethics
Do I think about ethical consequences from the software you make?

## What is ethics in software engineering?
As stated by (Thomas Owens, 2018)
> Software engineering ethics are a subset of engineering ethics and professional ethics applied to the design and development of software systems. Engineering ethics and engineering philosophy look at the relationship between the engineer as an individual, his or her employer, the client, and society in general.

## Why is ethics important in software engineering? 
Ethics should influence software engineers to consider who is affected by their work. To examine if they and their colleagues are treating other human beings with respect also to consider how the public, would view their decisions.

## What do you have to do as a software engineer to address ethical aspects in your work? 
According to (ACM Ethics, 2018) software engineers should follow ethics in their work in a professional manner. They should be able to follow the following eight principles:

> **PUBLIC** – Software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest. <br>
**CLIENT AND EMPLOYER** – Software engineers shall act in a manner that is in the best interests of their client and employer    consistent with the public interest. <br><br>
**PRODUCT** – Software engineers shall ensure that their products and related modifications meet the highest professional standards possible. <br><br>
**JUDGMENT** – Software engineers shall maintain integrity and independence in their professional judgment. <br><br>
**MANAGEMENT** – Software engineering managers and leaders shall subscribe to and promote an ethical approach to the management of software development and maintenance. <br><br>
**PROFESSION** – Software engineers shall advance the integrity and reputation of the profession consistent with the public interest. <br><br>
**COLLEAGUES** – Software engineers shall be fair to and supportive of their colleagues. <br><br>
**SELF** – Software engineers shall participate in lifelong learning regarding the practice of their profession and shall promote an ethical approach to the practice of the profession. <br>

Having almost 3-4 years experience as software developer in training I can confirm that I relate to these principles, in a smaller scope. That being that I only have experience within a safe working-space where I can still make mistakes.

## How do you know that your ethical considerations match with those of other software engineers? 
By respecting eachothers nature and talk about their view on ethics. If you can't quite agree with someone, you would have to find a middle ground. Reviewing eachothers work and being honest helps a lot with their view of what is right or wrong. This way, we can tell someone is being professional in their job.<br>

## Which ethical aspects play a role in your project? 
We have to act professional towards our product owners and teachers, as matter of fact it is a learning outcome. We do this by keeping the stakeholders up to date and ask questions when we are stuck on a problem. Furthermore, we  often have feedback-meetings where we discuss the progress and professionalism toward the project. <br>

## Do you foresee ethical conflicts caused by your software? What kind of?  

*For the next analysis I used the **TICT Tool** provided by Fontys (Semester 3, 2021, 22th of December), which helps evaluate the impact of the application:*

**Possible Stakeholders & Human values**: <br>
As our project being the automisation of a taking the orders, the ethical conflict is that servers in a restaurant would lose half a part of their job being taking the orders. <br><br>

**Privacy**: <br>
Me and my team consider the privacy of other people by securing the application. We make sure that QR-codes that are generated for each table aren't available for the public to manipulate. Therefore nobody but the people at the table can use the QR-code to order their food. <br><br>

**Data**: <br>
We make use of an architecture to where the scalability of the application is usable for up to ~250 restaurants. The data transferred would be the orders and along with the inventory management, they are used properly by a display (live-view) screen for the kitchen staff to look at and modify. <br><br>

**Future impact**:
I think this is a small step towards the future, automising is part of our generations thought; <br>
In a utopian scenario would be that all the servers still have jobs whilst the better part of the business-processes are automated. <br>
In a dystopian scenario this would get out of control to where the restaurant owners have to fire employees because of the automated jobs the applications provide. <br><br>

**Fairness & Bad actors**:
In my opinion this product would be fair depending on what the restaurant owners do with the help provided by the application. <br>
If the restaurant owners invest into more flexibility for the kitchen staff and servers to work with, yes it would be fair. <br>
If they decide to do nothing and eventually fire employees because of this application than it wouldn't be quite fair. <br><br>

**Transparency**:

I am fully aware what the architecture entails and what the limits are. Knowing what the limits are gives us a great estimate how long this project will take. <br>
If there was no limit, then it would be hard to pin-point a estimated delivery for the product owner. <br><br>
